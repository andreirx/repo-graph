## Current Priority

**CLI-OUT-2C: Stats Renderer** — CURRENT

Slice doc: `docs/slices/cli-out-2c-stats-renderer.md` (to be created)

Stats query pathology fixed. Stats now completes in under 6 seconds on all
tested repos. Renderer can proceed.

## Recently Fixed

**RMAPD-PERF-1: Stats Query Pathology** — STATS FIXED (2026-05-19)

Slice doc: `docs/slices/rmapd-perf-1-timeout.md`

Stats root cause (OBSERVED): `compute_module_stats` had correlated subqueries
with O(modules × edges × symbols) complexity.

Fix: Rewrote query with CTEs. Django stats improved from 760s to 3s (255x speedup).

Evidence: Instrumentation (`--features perf-trace`) confirmed before/after.

Not proven: Trust, cycles, other query performance. Timeout class mitigated,
not universally solved.

## Recently Validated

**CLI-OUT-2B: First-Contact Discovery Output** — VALIDATED (2026-05-18)

Slice doc: `docs/slices/cli-out-2b-output-redesign.md`
Review packet: `docs/audits/cli-out-2b/review-packet.md`

Delivered:
- Human renderer for `orient` with repo name, cycle topology, evidence-bearing degradation
- Human renderer for `trust` with resolution rates, reliability breakdown
- Human renderer for `cycles` with topology
- Validated on 5-repo corpus (OpenXcom, buildroot, django, duckdb, grpc-java)

## Handoff Complete

**CLI-OUT-2A: Cross-Repo Output Audit** — HANDOFF COMPLETE

Audit sufficient to drive first implementation wave. Findings in `docs/audits/cli-out-2a/`.

## Bug Slices

**ORIENT-BUG-1: Module Count Mismatch** — QUEUED

Orient shows 2-17 modules, trust shows 19-240+. Data/query bug.
See `docs/slices/orient-bug-1-module-count.md`.
